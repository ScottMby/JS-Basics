# JS-Basics
My first front-end project. A simple to-do list

I created this project as a base to start developing my skills within html, css and js.
I plan to develop these skills in order to start creating full stack web applications 
using a C# backend using ASP.net as well as learn a framework such as react for front
end development.

The application:
This application uses standard html, css and js. No frameworks were used and the task
data is saved with localstorage within the browser. As a result of this, the entire 
application only uses front-end code and could be hosted on a website with no need
for any databases or backend code.
